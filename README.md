# PythonPlayground
A wealth of Python projects for Applied Cryptography (including OTP, Public/Private key operations, Certifications, ...)

## FYI
Folders starting "instructor" are completely made by the instructor of Applied Cryptography. I added my code to these folders to the folders starting "my". I will document my contributions later. You can ask what I really developed by mailto:denizalp1634@gmail.com with subject PythonPlayground.
